The Strassen matrix multiplication is an efficient algorithm for multiplying square matrices, which reduces the number of scalar multiplications required compared to the traditional matrix multiplication algorithm. It was proposed by Volker Strassen in 1969.

The Strassen algorithm is based on the divide-and-conquer strategy and exploits the property that a matrix can be divided into smaller submatrices. Instead of performing eight matrix multiplications in the traditional method of matrix multiplication, the Strassen algorithm only performs seven matrix multiplications, thus reducing the total number of scalar multiplications needed.

The Strassen algorithm operates by dividing the input matrices into smaller submatrices and then performs various arithmetic operations to compute the submatrices of the output matrix. These operations are recursively performed on the submatrices until the size of the matrices is small enough to perform direct multiplication.

Although the Strassen algorithm has a lower asymptotic complexity than the traditional matrix multiplication algorithm, in practice, due to hidden constants and costs associated with recursion, it may be less efficient for small matrices. However, for large matrices, especially on systems with sufficient resources to handle recursion, the Strassen algorithm can offer significant improvements in runtime.
